abstract = {This study includes an analysis of the very recent European regulation relating to contracts for the supply of digital contents and services. This aims to strike a balance between the interests of consumers and that of professionals, which is particularly evident in the video game industry. This balance is sought through the need to provide and maintain a service that meets consumers' expectations, requiring professionals to implement appropriate solutions in the event of a lack of conformity. Maintening digital contents or services leads correlatively to the admission of corrective updates by users, thus integrating their accountability.},
